This is a program I created to examine texture in radiological imaging. 
The program can be fed DICOM files from any type of grayscale image or even JPEGS. 
The program then computes some parameters of texture within the area chosed.
Although I orginically created the program for abdominal imaging, the areas can be changed to suit whichever ones a radiologist would want.
