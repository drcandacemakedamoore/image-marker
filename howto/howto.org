* This document explains how to get Image Marker (Dvora) running on MS Windows
  Below is a step-by step walk-through.

  Watch out for yellow markings on some screenshots, they are there to
  poit configuration changes you need to do in order to make things work.

** Search for Anaconda
   Anaconda is a distribution of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)][Python programming language]] designed
   for scientific programming. =image-marker= is written in Python and
   relies on [[https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/][Anaconda]] for downloading support libraries.

** Find and download Anaconda
   Anaconda is a fairly popular project with many thousands of users
   around the world.  If you cannot copy a link from above, use your
   web search engine to locate it:

   [[find-anaconda.png]]

** Make sure to select correct Anaconda version
   Anaconda is available for different operating systems and processor
   architectures.  For example, if you are running MS Windows on a
   64-bit CPU, then this is likely the option you need:

   [[select-anaconda-download.png]]

** Discover what CPU you are using
   1. On Windows you would need to first open file explorer.
      [[open-windows-explorer.png]]
   2. Then right-click (invoke context menu) on =My Computer=.
      [[open-computer-proprties.png]]
   3. Then inspect your system's properties.

** Install Anaconda
   Once you have Anaconda downloaded, run its installer.

   [[select-to-install-anaconda.png]]

   Follow the installation wizard to completion.

** Make Anaconda your default Python
   Python distribution from python.org is the flagship distribution.
   Both Python from python.org and Anaconda provide the same Python
   interpreter.  However, if you don't yet have Python installed, and
   to make things easier for beginners, it's advisable to enable this
   option:

** We also need Git
   [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git][Git]] is a program that allows collaborative editing.  It is
   typically used by programmers to cooperate when developing
   software, but it is also useful for general-purpose file editing.
   It can store history, offer automatic means of resolving version
   conflicts in addition to content sharing.  You can use your web
   search to find Git for Windows download:

   [[search-git-windows.png]]

** Download Git
   There are many distributions of Git for Windows, for this example,
   we are going to use the one packaged by SCM:

   [[find-git-windows.png]]

   The download will start automatically, once you navigate to this site

   [[download-git-windows.png]]

** Launch Git installer
   Once the download finishes, launch it:

   [[launch-git-install.png]]

   As with Anaconda, follow the installation wizard.  The default
   settings should be fine.

** Run Git Bash
   Bash stands for Bourne Again Shell, which lost its meaning with
   time.  In our context, it will refer to a graphical terminal
   hosting a shell specially configured for using Git.  We need to use
   it in order to get hold of the source code of =image-marker=.

   [[launch-git-bash.png]]

** Locate Image Marker sources
   =image-marker= sources are available for general public through the
   use of free Git hosting provided by GitHub.  You can find them by
   following this URL:

   https://github.com/drcandacemakedamoore/image-marker

   [[github-clone-repository.png]]

   Once on the page, find the green button titled *clone or download*.
   Once you press it, the drop-down menu will allow you to copy the
   URL you need to use with Git:

   https://github.com/drcandacemakedamoore/image-marker.git

   Repeated here for your convenience.

** Clone Image Marker
   In order to work with =image-marker= sources you will need to use
   Git Bash to clone them.  Once you have the terminal window open,
   you should be able to type into it:

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     mkdir projects
     cd projects
     clone https://github.com/drcandacemakedamoore/image-marker.git
   #+END_SRC

   The regular copying and pasting will not work with this terminal
   (Control+C has a special meaning in this environment: it terminates
   the currently running program!)  You can, however, invoke context
   menu (say, by clicking the left mouse key) and then selecting to
   "paste" as shown in the image:

   [[paste-clone-url.png]]

** Create Conda environment
   =conda= is a package manager for Anaconda.  We use it to create
   isolated environments (so that in case you already work on another
   project we don't mess with it), and to install dependencies of our
   project.

   To create an environment run:

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     conda create -n image-marker
   #+END_SRC

   [[answer-conda-prompt.png]]

   You will be prompted to allow environment creation, answer with
   =Y=.

** Launch Anaconda Prompt
   It is possible to use =conda= and =python= from GitBash, but it
   requires more elaborate configuration.  In the interest of
   simplicity, we will use Anaconda Prompt.  To launch one, press
   =Windows= key and type /anaconda/.

   [[launch-anaconda-prompt.png]]

** Activate environment
   Type in the prompt:

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     conda activate image-marker
   #+END_SRC

   to set up the environment for =image-marker=.

   [[activate-image-marker.png]]

   Then change into directory where you cloned =image-marker=:

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     cd projects
     cd image-marker
   #+END_SRC

** Install Image Marker dependencies
   Finally, you need to run the setup script supplied with
   =image-marker= to fetch project's dependencies.

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     python setup.py install
   #+END_SRC
   
   [[setup-py-install.png]]

   If all goes well, you now should be able to launch the project.

** Launch Image Marker
   Depending on your firewall settings, you might be prompted to allow
   Python to access your local network.  This presents no security
   riscs as no information is being sent anywhere (that is why it is
   called "local").

   [[allow-python-local-network.png]]

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     python bin\imarker
   #+END_SRC

** Interact with Image Marker
   Now you should be able to interact with =image-marker= in your
   favorite web browser.  Type:

   : http://localhost:8080

   Into browser's address bar to navigate to the project's front page.
